E-commerce Crawler Apporch Summary :

Objective: Scrapes product pages from multiple e-commerce websites using URL pattern matching and HTML content analysis.

Crawler Setup:

Configurations (like max crawl depth, product URL patterns) stored in a CrawlConfig class.
EcommerceCrawler class manages the crawling logic and tracks visited URLs.
Product URL Detection:

Identifies product pages via URL patterns (e.g., /product/, /item/) and HTML content (e.g., "Add to Cart" buttons, schema.org markup).
Crawling Process:

Visits homepages, follows internal links recursively, and crawls multiple pages concurrently.
Concurrency:

Uses asynchronous programming (asyncio and aiohttp) for efficient, concurrent crawling.
Result Storage:

Product URLs saved in a JSON file.
Crawling statistics (e.g., pages crawled, product URLs found) are generated.
Flask API Integration:

Two endpoints:
GET / for status check.
POST /crawl to start crawling process.
Libraries Used:

asyncio, aiohttp, BeautifulSoup, re, logging, json, Flask, and others for efficient crawling, parsing, and managing results.
Challenges:

Page depth, large websites, rate-limiting, and dynamic content can slow down crawling.
Key Features:

Asynchronous Crawling: Concurrent crawling of multiple sites/pages.
Product Detection: Combines URL patterns and content analysis for high-confidence identification.
Statistics & Logging: Detailed logs and statistics for monitoring and debugging.
Customizable Configuration: Parameters like max depth, max pages, and product URL patterns.
